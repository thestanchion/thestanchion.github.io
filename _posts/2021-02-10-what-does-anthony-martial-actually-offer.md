When Manchester United slapped £50 odd million on the table for 19 year old Anthony Martial on the last day of the 2015 summer transfer window my reaction was not an excited one. Normally when your club splashes that sort of cash you've heard of the player before. When you spend that sort of money on a teenager, normally he's being spoken about regularly, is well known to the average football fan and is being linked with all sorts of big clubs.

Instead it was a transfer that reeked of desperation. Obviously the price tag wasn't his fault, and the club _had_ already spent fairly heavily on Depay, Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger and Darmian but van Persie and Chicharito had been sold, leaving van Gaal with very few options up front.

United had also just had two really poor seasons finishing in 7th and 4th following the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013. So it could have been potentially more difficult to attract top top players hence the signing of Martial, but they _did_ finish in the Champions League places, which is the standard pre-requisite you hear top players wanting if they're going to change clubs. The signing of Martial felt a bit deflating all things considered.

Despite that he made an instant impact, scoring on his debut vs Liverpool and following that up with another 3 goals in the next 3 games. The United fans wasted no time coming up with a new song for him - "Tony Marshall, came from France..." - and the signing seemed like a masterstroke at the end of his first 6 weeks.

But throughout the whole time he’s been at the club he’s just never taken his game to that next level. He sees himself as a centre forward, yet the fact that van Gaal played Fellini there instead of him at times tells you all you need to know about how well Martial can play that position. 

His finishing is poor, the amount of clear cut chances he misses or hits straight at the keeper is frightening for an international forward, you’re  more likely to get one worldie strike from him every 12 games. And that’s part of the problem, you can’t rely on him to get the scrappy goals in the 6 yard box which is the real top strikers earn their corn. It’s not good enough. 

Yes he scored 20 goals last season, but that was the one and only time that has happened in his career, and he has just 2 league goals this season in XXX apps

never looks interested

doesnt give enough

not a centre forward - never win the league with him playing number 9

Ole seems to agree as Cavani now starts most games

I’d be happy having him coming off the left but as a backup to rashford

best thing about him is his song
